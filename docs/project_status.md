# Project Status

Last updated: [Current Date]

## Recent Updates

1. Implemented multi-modal interaction:
   - Added image upload functionality to the frontend.
   - Integrated image processing in the backend.
   - Updated TaskPlannerAgent to handle image context in queries.

2. Enhanced frontend with React and shadcn-ui:
   - Migrated to a Next.js-based React frontend.
   - Implemented shadcn-ui components for improved UI.

3. Improved backend structure:
   - Updated Flask backend to serve as an API.
   - Implemented user authentication and session management.
   - Added rate limiting and HTTPS enforcement.

4. Enhanced knowledge base:
   - Added functionality to fetch and process arXiv papers.
   - Improved GitHub updates fetching.

5. Implemented RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with self-evaluation.

6. Set up basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

7. Addressed TypeScript linter errors in the frontend code.

## Current Status

1. Frontend:
   - React-based dashboard with shadcn-ui components.
   - Supports text queries and image uploads.
   - Displays system metrics and JARVIS workflow diagram.

2. Backend:
   - Flask-based API with user authentication and rate limiting.
   - Supports multi-modal queries (text + image).
   - Integrates with knowledge base for query processing.

3. Knowledge Base:
   - Includes Wikipedia articles, GitHub updates, and arXiv papers.
   - Supports periodic updates.

4. Task Planning:
   - Implements task decomposition and execution.
   - Handles multi-modal input (text + image).

5. Evaluation:
   - Implements RAG self-evaluation for performance assessment.

## Priority Items

1. Enhance image processing capabilities:
   - Implement more sophisticated image analysis (e.g., object detection, image classification).
   - Integrate image information more deeply into the query processing pipeline.

2. Improve error handling and logging:
   - Implement more comprehensive error handling throughout the system.
   - Enhance the logging system for better debugging and monitoring.

3. Expand test coverage:
   - Develop more unit tests for individual components.
   - Implement integration tests for the entire workflow.

4. Enhance security measures:
   - Implement proper data encryption at rest and in transit.
   - Set up regular security audits.

5. Optimize performance:
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
   - Optimize database queries and knowledge base retrieval process.

6. Implement continuous learning:
   - Develop a mechanism to automatically update the knowledge base based on user interactions.
   - Implement a feedback loop for model improvement.

## Next Steps

1. Implement advanced image processing techniques in the TaskPlannerAgent.
2. Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests.
3. Set up a production-ready deployment process.
4. Implement a more sophisticated continuous learning system.
5. Enhance the frontend to provide better feedback on image upload and processing.
6. Implement proper error handling and user feedback for failed operations.
7. Resolve remaining TypeScript issues in the frontend code.

## Open Questions

1. How can we most effectively integrate image understanding into the query processing pipeline?
2. What additional security measures should we implement for handling user-uploaded images?
3. How can we optimize the performance of the RAG system for larger knowledge bases?
4. What strategies can we employ to improve the TypeScript compatibility of our frontend components?

## Milestones

## Ongoing Challenges

1. Ensuring seamless integration between the React frontend and Flask backend.
2. Balancing the complexity of the system with maintainability and scalability.
3. Keeping up with rapid developments in AI and NLP technologies.

## Future Considerations

1. Exploring the potential for deploying JARVIS in a cloud environment for increased scalability.
2. Investigating the integration of more specialized AI models for specific tasks.
3. Considering the development of a mobile interface for JARVIS.
