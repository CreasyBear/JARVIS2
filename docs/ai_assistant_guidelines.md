# AI Assistant Guidelines for JARVIS Development

This document outlines the expected behavior and capabilities of an AI assistant (such as Cursor Composer or similar LLMs) when helping with the development and deployment of JARVIS.

## General Behavior

1. Be proactive in identifying potential issues or improvements in the codebase.
2. Provide clear, concise, and context-aware responses.
3. Always consider the project's current state and objectives when making suggestions.
4. Respect the existing architecture and design decisions unless there's a compelling reason to change them.

## Code Analysis and Suggestions

1. Analyze code for potential bugs, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement.
2. Suggest optimizations that align with the project's goals of scalability and efficiency.
3. Recommend best practices for Python development, especially in the context of async programming and microservices.
4. Identify and suggest solutions for potential security vulnerabilities.
5. Propose improvements for code readability and maintainability.

## Troubleshooting Assistance

1. Help diagnose issues by asking relevant questions about error messages, logs, or unexpected behaviors.
2. Suggest debugging strategies and tools appropriate for the JARVIS architecture.
3. Provide step-by-step guidance for isolating and resolving problems.
4. Offer explanations for why certain errors or issues might be occurring.

## Feature Development

1. Assist in breaking down new feature requests into manageable tasks.
2. Suggest implementation strategies that align with the existing architecture.
3. Provide code snippets or pseudocode to illustrate proposed solutions.
4. Highlight potential impacts on existing components when introducing new features.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

1. Suggest test cases for new features or changes.
2. Recommend improvements to the existing test suite.
3. Assist in writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
4. Propose strategies for improving test coverage and efficiency.

## Documentation

1. Suggest improvements or additions to existing documentation.
2. Assist in writing clear and concise documentation for new features or changes.
3. Help maintain up-to-date API documentation.
4. Propose improvements to the project's README and setup instructions.

## Deployment and DevOps

1. Provide guidance on deploying JARVIS in various environments.
2. Suggest best practices for containerization and orchestration.
3. Assist in setting up CI/CD pipelines.
4. Offer advice on monitoring, logging, and observability in a distributed system.

## Performance Optimization

1. Identify potential performance bottlenecks in the code.
2. Suggest strategies for optimizing resource usage, especially in a distributed environment.
3. Provide guidance on caching strategies and data flow optimization.
4. Assist in profiling and benchmarking different components of JARVIS.

## Security Considerations

1. Highlight potential security risks in the codebase or architecture.
2. Suggest best practices for securing API endpoints, data storage, and inter-service communication.
3. Provide guidance on implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
4. Assist in conducting security audits of the system.

## Scalability and Future-Proofing

1. Offer suggestions for improving the scalability of JARVIS.
2. Identify potential limitations in the current architecture and propose solutions.
3. Suggest strategies for making the system more modular and extensible.
4. Provide insights on emerging technologies or practices that could benefit JARVIS in the long term.

Remember, the AI assistant is a tool to augment your development process. Always review and validate any suggestions or code changes proposed by the AI before implementing them in the JARVIS project.
